                . Reported crime is not necessarily a direct cause of medical
                emergencies, nor all medical emergencies arise from reported
                crime. However, it was assumed as an approximate indicator of
                the probability of ambulance request in each node, due to the
                difficulty of obtaining datasets directly logging ambulance
                requests.

                Using the travel time data from Q1/20, a simulation was run 300
                times, each with 1000 total medical emergencies. The ambulance
                velocity was controlled at 20 km/h.(±2σ). This is the controlled
                set of simulations.

              <p>
                I first compared the effect of changing average ambulance speed
                on response time. Intuitively enough, the response time improves
                with higher average ambulance speed. This can be achieved in
                several ways; such as allowing the ambulance to excess local
                speed limits and/or skip red lights as appropriate.

              <br />

              <p>
                I was interested in what other factors additionally influenced
                response times. I decided to also simulate the effect of 8
                Thames bridges closing down separately. This was done by
                removing the corresponding edges in the network.

              <br />

              <p>
                Closing down Lambeth bridge had the most significant slowdown
                effect on ambulance response (±2σ).

              <p>
                At this point, I wanted to explore how to most optimally place
                additional hospitals within central London to improve the
                overall emergency response time in the area. I examined some of
                the worst-responded nodes in the default simulation to identify
                the particularly vulnerable and inaccessible neighborhoods. Once
                I had identified them, I ran new simulations with a hypothetical
                placement of one additional hospital in a node belonging to such
                a neighborhood.
              </p>

                }}
              />
              <br />

              <p>
                For example, adding a hospital in node 922 yielded approximately
                30 seconds of expected improvement per response overall; in a
                matter of life or death, this improvement can save or kill a
                life. The comparison below shows us that three strategic
                additional hospitals will significantly improves the pain
                regions in the northeast and southwest.
